How to Contribute
=================

Liferay is developed by its community consisting of Liferay users, enthusiasts, employees, customers, partners, and others. If you want to contribute to Liferay and you don't want to feel alone, you are welcome to this Organization (LSUG). If you aren't Spanish or you don't talk Spanish, it won't be a problem, you are also welcome too! You just have to send us pull requests or put your suggestions at our forum: http://www.liferay.com/es/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/9954688.

As you have ideas for features you want to implement, follow the contribution steps outlined in the CONTRIBUTING guide (https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.markdown) found in the liferay-portal repository (https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal). This guide contains details on how to contribute to Liferay and additional useful resource links. For more details on specific steps, and to get a deeper understanding of Liferay in general, make sure to read Liferay's official User Guide (http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide) and Development Guide (http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/development). These guides contain extensive explanations, examples, and reference material for you to consult time and time again.

If you have doubts on how to contribute or code your contributions, just ask for help in our forums or contact to one member of the community.
